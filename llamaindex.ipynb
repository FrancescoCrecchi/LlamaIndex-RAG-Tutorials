It is powered by\\nstate-of-the-art specialized AI models for layout analysis (DocLayNet) and table\\nstructure recognition (TableFormer), and runs efficiently on commodity hardware\\nin a small resource budget. The code interface allows for easy extensibility and\\naddition of new features and models.\\n1 Introduction\\nConverting PDF documents back into a machine-processable format has been a major challenge\\nfor decades due to their huge variability in formats, weak standardization and printing-optimized\\ncharacteristic, which discards most structural features and metadata. With the advent of LLMs\\nand popular application patterns such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), leveraging the rich\\ncontent embedded in PDFs has become ever more relevant. In the past decade, several powerful\\ndocument understanding solutions have emerged on the market, most of which are commercial soft-\\nware, cloud offerings [3] and most recently, multi-modal vision-language models. As of today, only\\na handful of open-source tools cover PDF conversion, leaving a significant feature and quality gap\\nto proprietary solutions.\\nWith Docling, we open-source a very capable and efficient document conversion tool which builds\\non the powerful, specialized AI models and datasets for layout analysis and table structure recog-\\nnition we developed and presented in the recent past [12, 13, 9]. Docling is designed as a simple,\\nself-contained python library with permissive license, running entirely locally on commodity hard-\\nware. Its code architecture allows for easy extensibility and addition of new features and models.\\nDocling Technical Report\\n1\\narXiv:2408.09869v5  [cs.CL]  9 Dec 2024', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Documentation and examples\\nare available in our GitHub repository at github.com/DS4SD/docling. All required model assets1 are\\ndownloaded to a local huggingface datasets cache on first use, unless you choose to pre-install the\\nmodel assets in advance.\\nDocling provides an easy code interface to convert PDF documents from file system, URLs or binary\\nstreams, and retrieve the output in either JSON or Markdown format. For convenience, separate\\nmethods are offered to convert single documents or batches of documents. A basic usage example\\nis illustrated below. Further examples are available in the Doclign code repository.\\nfrom docling . document_converter import DocumentConverter\\nsource = \" https :// arxiv . org / pdf /2206.01062 \" # PDF path or URL\\nconverter = DocumentConverter ()\\nresult = converter . convert_single ( source )\\nprint ( result . render_as_markdown ()) # output : \"## DocLayNet : A Large\\nHuman - Annotated Dataset for Document - Layout Analysis [...]\"\\nOptionally, you can configure custom pipeline features and runtime options, such as turning on or\\noff features (e.g. OCR, table structure recognition), enforcing limits on the input document size, and\\ndefining the budget of CPU threads. Advanced usage examples and options are documented in the\\nREADME file. Docling also provides a Dockerfile to demonstrate how to install and run it inside a\\ncontainer.\\n3 Processing pipeline\\nDocling implements a linear pipeline of operations, which execute sequentially on each given docu-\\nment (see Fig. 1). Each document is first parsed by a PDF backend, which retrieves the programmatic\\ntext tokens, consisting of string content and its coordinates on the page, and also renders a bitmap\\nimage of each page to support downstream operations. Then, the standard model pipeline applies a\\nsequence of AI models independently on every page in the document to extract features and content,\\nsuch as layout and table structures. Finally, the results from all pages are aggregated and passed\\nthrough a post-processing stage, which augments metadata, detects the document language, infers\\nreading-order and eventually assembles a typed document object which can be serialized to JSON\\nor Markdown.\\n3.1 PDF backends\\nTwo basic requirements to process PDF documents in our pipeline are a) to retrieve all text content\\nand their geometric coordinates on each page and b) to render the visual representation of each\\npage as it would appear in a PDF viewer. Both these requirements are encapsulated in Docling’s\\nPDF backend interface. While there are several open-source PDF parsing libraries available for\\npython, we faced major obstacles with all of them for different reasons, among which were restrictive\\n1see huggingface.co/ds4sd/docling-models/\\n2', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is made available in a separate\\npackage named docling-parse and powers the default PDF backend in Docling. As an alternative,\\nwe provide a PDF backend relying onpypdfium, which may be a safe backup choice in certain cases,\\ne.g. if issues are seen with particular font encodings.\\n3.2 AI models\\nAs part of Docling, we initially release two highly capable AI models to the open-source community,\\nwhich have been developed and published recently by our team. The first model is a layout analysis\\nmodel, an accurate object-detector for page elements [13]. The second model is TableFormer [12, 9],\\na state-of-the-art table structure recognition model. We provide the pre-trained weights (hosted on\\nhuggingface) and a separate package for the inference code as docling-ibm-models. Both models\\nare also powering the open-access deepsearch-experience, our cloud-native service for knowledge\\nexploration tasks.\\nLayout Analysis Model\\nOur layout analysis model is an object-detector which predicts the bounding-boxes and classes of\\nvarious elements on the image of a given page. Its architecture is derived from RT-DETR [16] and\\nre-trained on DocLayNet [13], our popular human-annotated dataset for document-layout analysis,\\namong other proprietary datasets. For inference, our implementation relies on the onnxruntime [5].\\nThe Docling pipeline feeds page images at 72 dpi resolution, which can be processed on a single\\nCPU with sub-second latency. All predicted bounding-box proposals for document elements are\\npost-processed to remove overlapping proposals based on confidence and size, and then intersected\\nwith the text tokens in the PDF to group them into meaningful and complete units such as paragraphs,\\nsection titles, list items, captions, figures or tables.\\nTable Structure Recognition\\nThe TableFormer model [12], first published in 2022 and since refined with a custom structure token\\nlanguage [9], is a vision-transformer model for table structure recovery. It can predict the logical\\nrow and column structure of a given table based on an input image, and determine which table\\ncells belong to column headers, row headers or the table body. Compared to earlier approaches,\\nTableFormer handles many characteristics of tables, such as partial or no borderlines, empty cells,\\nrows or columns, cell spans and hierarchy both on column-heading or row-heading level, tables with\\ninconsistent indentation or alignment and other complexities. For inference, our implementation\\nrelies on PyTorch[2].\\n3', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

TableFormer structure predic-\\ntions are matched back to the PDF cells in post-processing to avoid expensive re-transcription text\\nin the table image. Typical tables require between 2 and 6 seconds to be processed on a standard\\nCPU, strongly depending on the amount of included table cells.\\nOCR\\nDocling provides optional support for OCR, for example to cover scanned PDFs or content in\\nbitmaps images embedded on a page. In our initial release, we rely onEasyOCR [1], a popular third-\\nparty OCR library with support for many languages. Docling, by default, feeds a high-resolution\\npage image (216 dpi) to the OCR engine, to allow capturing small print detail in decent quality.\\nWhile EasyOCR delivers reasonable transcription quality, we observe that it runs fairly slow on\\nCPU (upwards of 30 seconds per page).\\nWe are actively seeking collaboration from the open-source community to extend Docling with\\nadditional OCR backends and speed improvements.\\n3.3 Assembly\\nIn the final pipeline stage, Docling assembles all prediction results produced on each page into a\\nwell-defined datatype that encapsulates a converted document, as defined in the auxiliary package\\ndocling-core. The generated document object is passed through a post-processing model which\\nleverages several algorithms to augment features, such as detection of the document language, cor-\\nrecting the reading order, matching figures with captions and labelling metadata such as title, authors\\nand references. The final output can then be serialized to JSON or transformed into a Markdown\\nrepresentation at the users request.\\n3.4 Extensibility\\nDocling provides a straight-forward interface to extend its capabilities, namely the model pipeline.\\nA model pipeline constitutes the central part in the processing, following initial document parsing\\nand preceding output assembly, and can be fully customized by sub-classing from an abstract base-\\nclass (BaseModelPipeline) or cloning the default model pipeline. This effectively allows to fully\\ncustomize the chain of models, add or replace models, and introduce additional pipeline config-\\nuration parameters. To use a custom model pipeline, the custom pipeline class to instantiate can\\nbe provided as an argument to the main document conversion methods. We invite everyone in the\\ncommunity to propose additional or alternative models and improvements.\\nImplementations of model classes must satisfy the pythonCallable interface. The __call__ method\\nmust accept an iterator over page objects, and produce another iterator over the page objects which\\nwere augmented with the additional features predicted by the model, by extending the provided\\nPagePredictions data model accordingly.\\n4 Performance\\nIn this section, we establish some reference numbers for the processing speed of Docling and the\\nresource budget it requires. All tests in this section are run with default options on our standard test\\nset distributed with Docling, which consists of three papers from arXiv and two IBM Redbooks,\\nwith a total of 225 pages. Measurements were taken using both available PDF backends on two\\ndifferent hardware systems: one MacBook Pro M3 Max, and one bare-metal server running Ubuntu\\n20.04 LTS on an Intel Xeon E5-2690 CPU. For reproducibility, we fixed the thread budget (through\\nsetting OMP NUM THREADS environment variable) once to 4 (Docling default) and once to 16\\n(equal to full core count on the test hardware). All results are shown in Table 1.\\nIf you need to run Docling in very low-resource environments, please consider configuring the\\npypdfium backend. While it is faster and more memory efficient than the default docling-parse\\nbackend, it will come at the expense of worse quality results, especially in table structure recovery.\\nEstablishing GPU acceleration support for the AI models is currently work-in-progress and largely\\nuntested, but may work implicitly when CUDA is available and discovered by the onnxruntime and\\n4', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For example, Docling can provide a base\\nfor detailed enterprise document search, passage retrieval or classification use-cases, or support\\nknowledge extraction pipelines, allowing specific treatment of different structures in the document,\\nsuch as tables, figures, section structure or references. For popular generative AI application pat-\\nterns, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we providequackling, an open-source package\\nwhich capitalizes on Docling’s feature-rich document output to enable document-native optimized\\nvector embedding and chunking. It plugs in seamlessly with LLM frameworks such as LlamaIn-\\ndex [8]. Since Docling is fast, stable and cheap to run, it also makes for an excellent choice to build\\ndocument-derived datasets. With its powerful table structure recognition, it provides significant ben-\\nefit to automated knowledge-base construction [11, 10]. Docling is also integrated within the open\\nIBM data prep kit [6], which implements scalable data transforms to build large-scale multi-modal\\ntraining datasets.\\n6 Future work and contributions\\nDocling is designed to allow easy extension of the model library and pipelines. In the future, we\\nplan to extend Docling with several more models, such as a figure-classifier model, an equation-\\nrecognition model, a code-recognition model and more. This will help improve the quality of con-\\nversion for specific types of content, as well as augment extracted document metadata with ad-\\nditional information. Further investment into testing and optimizing GPU acceleration as well as\\nimproving the Docling-native PDF backend are on our roadmap, too.\\nWe encourage everyone to propose or implement additional features and models, and will\\ngladly take your inputs and contributions under review. The codebase of Docling is open for use\\nand contribution, under the MIT license agreement and in alignment with our contributing guidelines\\nincluded in the Docling repository.

The challenge originatesfrom the huge variability in PDF documents regarding layout, language and formats (scanned, programmatic or a combination of both). Engineering asingle ML model that can be applied on all types of documents and provides high-quality layout segmentation remains to this day extremelychallenging [5]. To highlight the variability in document layouts, we show a few example documents from the DocLayNet dataset in Figure 1.\\nDocLayNet: A Large Human-Annotated Dataset for Document-Layout Analysis\\nABSTRACT\\nCCS CONCEPTS\\nKEYWORDS\\nACM Reference Format:\\n1 INTRODUCTION\\nDocLayNet: A Large Human-Annotated Dataset for\\nDocument-Layout Analysis\\nBirgit P\\ufffftzmannIBM Research\\nRueschlikon, Switzerland\\nbpf@zurich.ibm.com\\nChristoph AuerIBM Research\\nRueschlikon, Switzerland\\ncau@zurich.ibm.com\\nMichele Dol\\uffffIBM Research\\nRueschlikon, Switzerland\\ndol@zurich.ibm.com\\nAhmed S.

The vertical tube can be used for       instructional viewing or to photograph     the image with a digital camera or a     micro TV unit 2. Loosen the retention screw, then rotate      the adjustment ring to change the       length of the vertical tube.3. Make sure that both the images in \\nOPERATION (cont.)SELECTING OBJECTIVE MAGNIFICATION  1. There are two objectives. The lower      magnification objective has a greater      depth of field and view.2. In order to observe the specimen      easily use the lower magnification      objective first. Then, by rotating the      case, the magnification can be       changed.CHANGING THE INTERPUPILLARY DISTANCE1. The distance between the observer's      pupils is the interpupillary distance.   2. To adjust the interpupillary distance      rotate the prism caps until both eyes      coincide with the image in the       eyepiece.  FOCUSING1. Remove the lens protective cover.2. Place the specimen on the working      stage.3. Focus the specimen with the left eye      first while turning the focus knob until      the image appears clear and sharp.4. Rotate the right eyepiece ring until the      images in each eyepiece coincide and      are sharp and clear.CHANGING THE BULB1. Disconnect the power cord.2. When the bulb is cool, remove the      oblique illuminator cap and remove      the halogen bulb with cap.3. Replace with a new halogen bulb.4. Open the window in the base plate and      replace the halogen lamp or       fluorescent lamp of transmitted       illuminator.\\nFOCUSING1. Turn the focusing knob away or toward      you until a clear image is viewed.2. If the image is unclear, adjust the      height of the elevator up or down,      then turn the focusing knob again.ZOOM MAGNIFICATION1. Turn the zoom magnification knob to      the desired magnification and field of      view.2. In most situations, it is recommended      that you focus at the lowest       magnification, then move to a higher      magnification and re-focus as       necessary.3. If the image is not clear to both eyes      at the same time, the diopter ring may      need adjustment.DIOPTER RING ADJUSTMENT1. To adjust the eyepiece for viewing with      or without eyeglasses and for       differences in acuity between the right      and left eyes, follow the following      steps:    a. Observe an image through the left          eyepiece and bring a specific point          into focus using the focus knob.    b. By turning the diopter ring           adjustment for the left eyepiece,          bring the same point into sharp          focus.     c.Then bring the same point into          focus through the right eyepiece           by turning the right diopter ring.     d.With more than one viewer, each          viewer should note their own           diopter ring position for the left           and right eyepieces, then before          viewing set the diopter ring           adjustments to that setting.CHANGING THE BULB1. Disconnect the power cord from the      electrical outlet.2. When the bulb is cool, remove the      oblique illuminator cap and remove      the halogen bulb with cap.3. Replace with a new halogen bulb.4. Open the window in the base plate       and replace the halogen lamp or      fluorescent lamp of transmitted       illuminator.     \\nModel AY11230Model AY11234\\n14\\nObjectivesRevolving Turret\\nCoarse AdjustmentKnob\\nMODEL AY11236\\nMICROSCOPE USAGEBARSKA Model AY11236 is a powerful fixed power compound microscope designed for biological studies such as specimen examination.

As discussed in Section 2, object detection\\nmodels are currently the easiest to use, due to the standardisation\\nof ground-truth data in COCO format [16] and the availability of\\ngeneral frameworks such asdetectron2[17]. Furthermore, baseline\\nnumbers in PubLayNet and DocBank were obtained using standard\\nobject detection models such as Mask R-CNN and Faster R-CNN.\\nAs such, we will relate to these object detection methods in this\\nFigure 5: Prediction performance (mAP@0.5-0.95) of a Mask\\nR-CNN network with ResNet50 backbone trained on increas-\\ning fractions of the DocLayNet dataset.

Similarly\\nas in PubLayNet, we will evaluate the quality of their predictions\\nusing mean average precision (mAP) with 10 overlaps that range\\nfrom 0.5 to 0.95 in steps of 0.05 (mAP@0.5-0.95). These scores are\\ncomputed by leveraging the evaluation code provided by the COCO\\nAPI [16].\\nBaselines for Object Detection\\nIn Table 2, we present baseline experiments (given in mAP) on Mask\\nR-CNN [12], Faster R-CNN [11], and YOLOv5 [13]. Both training\\nand evaluation were performed on RGB images with dimensions of\\n1025⇥1025pixels. For training, we only used one annotation in case\\nof redundantly annotated pages. As one can observe, the variation\\nin mAP between the models is rather low, but overall between 6\\nand 10% lower than the mAP computed from the pairwise human\\nannotations on triple-annotated pages. This gives a good indication\\nthat the DocLayNet dataset poses a worthwhile challenge for the\\nresearch community to close the gap between human recognition\\nand ML approaches. It is interesting to see that Mask R-CNN and\\nFaster R-CNN produce very comparable mAP scores, indicating\\nthat pixel-based image segmentation derived from bounding-boxes\\ndoes not help to obtain better predictions. On the other hand, the\\nmore recent Yolov5x model does very well and even out-performs\\nhumans on selected labels such asText,TableandPicture. This is\\nnot entirely surprising, asText,TableandPictureare abundant and\\nthe most visually distinctive in a document.\\nFigure 3: Page 6 of the DocLayNet paper.

Un-\\nfortunately, existing LM pipelines are typically implemented using hard-coded\\n“prompt templates”, i.e. lengthy strings discovered via trial and error. Toward a\\nmore systematic approach for developing and optimizing LM pipelines, we intro-\\nduce DSPy, a programming model that abstracts LM pipelines astext transforma-\\ntion graphs, i.e. imperative computation graphs where LMs are invoked through\\ndeclarative modules. DSPy modules are parameterized, meaning they can learn\\n(by creating and collecting demonstrations) how to apply compositions of prompt-\\ning, finetuning, augmentation, and reasoning techniques. We design a compiler\\nthat will optimize any DSPy pipeline to maximize a given metric. We conduct\\ntwo case studies, showing that succinct DSPy programs can express and optimize\\nsophisticated LM pipelines that reason about math word problems, tackle multi-\\nhop retrieval, answer complex questions, and control agent loops. Within minutes\\nof compiling, a few lines of DSPy allow GPT-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat to self-\\nbootstrap pipelines that outperform standard few-shot prompting (generally by\\nover 25% and 65%, respectively) and pipelines with expert-created demonstra-\\ntions (by up to 5–46% and 16–40%, respectively). On top of that, DSPy pro-\\ngrams compiled to open and relatively small LMs like 770M-parameter T5 and\\nllama2-13b-chat are competitive with approaches that rely on expert-written\\nprompt chains for proprietary GPT-3.5.\\nDSPy is available at https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nLanguage models (LMs) are enabling researchers to build NLP systems at higher levels of abstrac-\\ntion and with lower data requirements than ever before (Bommasani et al., 2021). This is fueling an\\nexploding space of “prompting” techniques—and lightweight finetuning techniques—for adapting\\nLMs to new tasks (Kojima et al., 2022), eliciting systematic reasoning from them (Wei et al., 2022;\\nWang et al., 2022b), andaugmenting them with retrieved sources (Guu et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al.,\\n2022; Khattab et al., 2022) or with tools (Yao et al., 2022; Schick et al., 2023). Most of these tech-\\nniques are explored in isolation, but interest has been growing in building multi-stage pipelines and\\nagents that decompose complex tasks into more manageable calls to LMs in an effort to improve\\nperformance (Qi et al., 2019; Khattab et al., 2021a; Karpas et al., 2022; Dohan et al., 2022; Khot\\net al., 2022; Khattab et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2022; Pourreza & Rafiei, 2023; Shinn et al., 2023).\\nUnfortunately, LMs are known to be sensitive to how they are prompted for each task, and this is\\nexacerbated in pipelines where multiple LM calls have to interact effectively.

We argue that this approach, while pervasive, can be brittle\\nand unscalable—conceptually akin to hand-tuning the weights for a classifier. A given string prompt\\nmight not generalize to different pipelines or across different LMs, data domains, or even inputs.\\nToward a more systematic approach to designing AI pipelines, we introduce theDSPy programming\\nmodel.1 DSPy pushes building new LM pipelines away from manipulating free-form strings and\\ncloser to programming (composing modular operators to build text transformation graphs) where a\\ncompiler automatically generates optimized LM invocation strategies and prompts from a program.\\nWe draw inspiration from the consensus that emerged around neural network abstractions (Bergstra\\net al., 2013), where (1) many general-purpose layers can be modularly composed in any complex\\narchitecture and (2) the model weights can be trained using optimizers instead of being hand-tuned.\\nTo this end, we propose the DSPy programming model(Sec 3). We first translate string-based\\nprompting techniques, including complex and task-dependent ones like Chain of Thought (Wei et al.,\\n2022) and ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), into declarative modules that carrynatural-language typed sig-\\nnatures. DSPy modules are task-adaptive components—akin to neural network layers—that abstract\\nany particular text transformation, like answering a question or summarizing a paper. We then pa-\\nrameterize each module so that it can learn its desired behavior by iteratively bootstrapping useful\\ndemonstrations within the pipeline. Inspired directly by PyTorch abstractions (Paszke et al., 2019),\\nDSPy modules are used via expressive define-by-run computational graphs. Pipelines are expressed\\nby (1) declaring the modules needed and (2) using these modules in any logical control flow (e.g.,\\nifstatements, for loops, exceptions, etc.) to logically connect the modules.\\nWe then develop theDSPy compiler(Sec 4), which optimizes any DSPy program to improve quality\\nor cost. The compiler inputs are the program, a few training inputs with optional labels, and a valida-\\ntion metric. The compiler simulates versions of the program on the inputs and bootstraps example\\ntraces of each module for self-improvement, using them to construct effective few-shot prompts\\nor finetuning small LMs for steps of the pipeline. Optimization in DSPy is highly modular: it is\\nconducted by teleprompters,2 which are general-purpose optimization strategies that determine how\\nthe modules should learn from data. In this way, the compiler automatically maps the declarative\\nmodules to high-quality compositions of prompting, finetuning, reasoning, and augmentation.\\nProgramming models like DSPy could be assessed along many dimensions, but we focus on the role\\nof expert-crafted prompts in shaping system performance. We are seeking to reduce or even remove\\ntheir role through DSPy modules (e.g., versions of popular techniques like Chain of Thought) and\\nteleprompters. We report on two expansive case studies: math word problems (GMS8K; Cobbe et al.\\n2021) and multi-hop question answering (HotPotQA; Yang et al. 2018) with explorations of chain\\nof thought, multi-chain reflection, multi-hop retrieval, retrieval-augmented question answering, and\\nagent loops. Our evaluations use a number of different compiling strategies effectively and show\\nthat straightforward DSPy programs outperform systems using hand-crafted prompts, while also\\nallowing our programs to use much smaller and hence more efficient LMs effectively.\\nOverall, this work proposes the first programming model that translates prompting techniques into\\nparameterized declarative modules and introduces an effective compiler with general optimiza-\\ntion strategies (teleprompters) to optimize arbitrary pipelines of these modules. Our main contri-\\nbutions are empirical and algorithmic: with DSPy, we have found that we can implement very\\nshort programs that can bootstrap self-improving multi-stage NLP systems using LMs as small as\\nllama2-13b-chat and T5-Large (770M parameters). Without hand-crafted prompts and within\\nminutes to tens of minutes of compiling, compositions of DSPy modules can raise the quality of\\nsimple programs from 33% to 82% (Sec 6) and from 32% to 46% (Sec 7) for GPT-3.5 and, simi-\\nlarly, from 9% to 47% (Sec 6) and from 22% to 41% (Sec 7) for llama2-13b-chat.\\n1DSPy is pronounced dee-ess-pie.

A similar transformation is emerging with higher-\\nlevel pipelines of LMs, and we are seeking to offer a solid conceptual framework and programming\\nabstractions for what we call foundation model programming. We draw on differentiable program-\\nming (Wang et al., 2018) but applied to LM calls rather than neural networks, and borrow syntactic\\nelements from PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019).\\nIn-context learning (McCann et al. 2018; Radford et al. 2018; Brown et al. 2020) is a key mechanism\\nfor foundation model programming. A growing body of work has revealed that, especially with\\ninstruction tuning (Ouyang et al., 2022), we can elicit sophisticated behavior via prompting (Wei\\net al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022b; Press et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022; Khot et al., 2022; Madaan et al.,\\n2023). Similarly, forms of weak supervision that would normally require task-specific (Khattab\\net al., 2021a;b) or hand-built (Ratner et al., 2016; Hancock et al., 2018) heuristics are now done by\\nLMs (Wang et al., 2022b; Zelikman et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2023).\\nIn-context learning methods now routinely invoke tools, leading to LM pipelines that use retrieval\\nmodels (Chen et al., 2017; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020; Lazaridou et al., 2022; Izacard et al.,\\n2022), multimodal foundation models, and more traditional tools like APIs (Nakano et al., 2021)\\nand calculators. A number of toolkits have been developed to facilitate this, including LangChain\\n(Chase, 2022), Semantic Kernel (Microsoft, 2023), LlamaIndex (Liu, 2022), and many other re-\\ntrieval and agent libraries. These toolkits provide pre-packaged chains and agents that connect\\nLMs with numerous accessible tools. However, they suffer from the pervasive prompt engineering\\nchallenges we address in DSPy: they express task-specific behavior through hand-written prompt\\ntemplates (for detailed discussion, see Appendix B).\\nResearchers are starting to apply discrete optimization and RL to find effective prompts, generally\\nfor a single logical LM call (Guo et al., 2023; Pryzant et al., 2023; Huang et al., 2022; Yang et al.,\\n2023). DSPy seeks to generalize this space: it offers a rich framework for optimizing arbitrary\\npipelines from high-level declarative signatures, by bootstrapping high-quality multi-stage demon-\\nstrations with constraints. In this framework, DSPy teleprompters may apply optimization using\\nmodel selection techniques like cross-validation or, in principle, with sophisticated techniques in-\\nvolving RL and LM feedback (Hu et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023a; Shinn et al., 2023) or learned or\\nBayesian hyperparameter optimization methods (Bergstra et al., 2013; Akiba et al., 2019).\\nThe present paper seeks to motivate DSPy as a programming model and to report new empirical\\nfindings from applying the DSPy compiler. This is inspired by formative work by Bergstra et al.\\n(2010; 2013), Paszke et al. (2019), and Wolf et al. (2020), who support their respective programming\\nmodels with a mix of benchmark numbers and some qualitative measures. For the current paper, we\\nfocus on showing that DSPy and its compiler allow us to build outstanding LM systems without\\nhand-crafted prompt strings, but instead from truly modular units, and that this opens up doors for\\nsystematically exploring a rich design space at a very high programmatic level of abstraction.\\n3 T HE DSP Y PROGRAMMING MODEL\\nWe present DSPy, which treats LMs as abstract devices for text generation,3 and optimizes their us-\\nage in arbitrary computational graphs. DSPy programs are expressed in Python: each program takes\\nthe task input (e.g., a question to answer or a paper to summarize) and returns the output (e.g., an\\nanswer or a summary) after a series of steps. DSPy contributes three abstractions toward automatic\\noptimization: signatures, modules, and teleprompters. Signatures abstract the input/output behavior\\nof a module; modules replace existing hand-prompting techniques and can be composed in arbitrary\\npipelines; and teleprompters optimize all modules in the pipeline to maximize a metric.\\n3We assume access to one or more LMs, which consume a prompt string and return text completions. This\\nmay be a promptable LM capable of in-context learning (e.g., GPT-3.5 or Llama2-7b) or a smaller finetuneable\\nLM (e.g., T5-base). An LM may be selected as the default; operations will use it unless configured otherwise.\\n3', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

A DSPy signature isnatural-language typed declaration of a function: a short declarative\\nspec that tells DSPy what a text transformation needs to do (e.g., “consume questions and return\\nanswers”), rather than how a specific LM should be prompted to implement that behavior. More\\nformally, a DSPy signature is a tuple of input fields and output fields (and an optional instruction).\\nA field consists offield name and optional metadata.4 In typical usage, the roles of fields are inferred\\nby DSPy as a function of field names. For instance, the DSPy compiler will use in-context learning\\nto interpret questiondifferently from answer and will iteratively refine its usage of these fields.\\nSignatures offer two benefits over prompts: they can be compiled into self-improving and pipeline-\\nadaptive prompts or finetunes. This is primarily done by bootstrapping (Sec 4) useful demonstrating\\nexamples for each signature. Additionally, they handle structured formatting and parsing logic to\\nreduce (or, ideally, avoid) brittle string manipulation in user programs.\\nIn practice, DSPy signatures can be expressed with a shorthand notation likequestion -> answer,\\nso that line 1 in the following is a complete DSPy program for a basic question-answering system\\n(with line 2 illustrating usage and line 3 the response when GPT-3.5 is the LM):\\n1 qa = dspy.Predict(\"question -> answer\")\\n2 qa(question=\"Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?\")\\n3 # Out: Prediction(answer=’Guaran ´ı is spoken mainly in South America.’)\\nIn the shorthand notation, each field’s name indicates the semantic role that the input (or output)\\nfield plays in the transformation. DSPy will parse this notation and expand the field names into\\nmeaningful instructions for the LM, so that english document -> french translation would\\nprompt for English to French translation. When needed, DSPy offers more advanced programming\\ninterfaces for expressing more explicit constraints on signatures (Appendix A).\\n3.2 P ARAMETERIZED & TEMPLATED MODULES CAN ABSTRACT PROMPTING TECHNIQUES\\nAkin to type signatures in programming languages, DSPy signatures simply define an interface and\\nprovide type-like hints on the expected behavior. To use a signature, we must declare amodule with\\nthat signature, like we instantiated a Predict module above. A module declaration like this returns\\na function having that signature.\\nThe Predict Module The core module for working with signatures in DSPy isPredict(simplified\\npseudocode in Appendix D.1). Internally, Predict stores the supplied signature, an optional LM to\\nuse (initially None, but otherwise overrides the default LM for this module), and a list of demon-\\nstrations for prompting (initially empty). Like layers in PyTorch, the instantiated module behaves as\\na callable function: it takes in keyword arguments corresponding to the signature input fields (e.g.,\\nquestion), formats a prompt to implement the signature and includes the appropriate demonstra-\\ntions, calls the LM, and parses the output fields. When Predict detects it’s being used in compile\\nmode, it will also internally track input/output traces to assist the teleprompter at bootstrapping the\\ndemonstrations.\\nOther Built-in ModulesDSPy modules translate prompting techniques into modular functions that\\nsupport any signature, contrasting with the standard approach of prompting LMs with task-specific\\ndetails (e.g., hand-written few-shot examples). To this end, DSPy includes a number of more sophis-\\nticated modules like ChainOfThought, ProgramOfThought, MultiChainComparison, and ReAct.5\\nThese can all be used interchangeably to implement a DSPy signature. For instance, simply chang-\\n4String descriptions of the task and the fields are also optional and usually omitted. Fields can carry optional\\nfield prefix and description. By default, fields are assumed to hold free-form strings; we are actively exploring\\noptional data type as a way to specify constraints on valid values (e.g.,boolor int) and more gracefully handle\\nformatting and parsing logic, though this feature is not core to DSPy at the time of writing.\\n5These modules generalize prompting techniques from the literature, respectively, by Wei et al. (2022),\\nChen et al. (2022), Yoran et al. (2023), and Yao et al. (2022) and, in doing so, generalize the ideas on zero-shot\\nprompting and rationale self-generation from Kojima et al. (2022), Zelikman et al. (2022), Zhang et al. (2022),\\nand Huang et al. (2022) to parameterized modules that can bootstrap arbitrary multi-stage pipelines.\\n4', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

For\\ninstance, we show a simplified implementation of the built-in ChainOfThought below.\\n1 class ChainOfThought(dspy.Module):\\n2 def __init__(self, signature):\\n3 # Modify signature from ‘*inputs -> *outputs‘ to ‘*inputs -> rationale, *outputs‘.\\n4 rationale_field = dspy.OutputField(prefix=\"Reasoning: Let’s think step by step.\")\\n5 signature = dspy.Signature(signature).prepend_output_field(rationale_field)\\n6\\n7 # Declare a sub-module with the modified signature.\\n8 self.predict = dspy.Predict(signature)\\n9\\n10 def forward(self, **kwargs):\\n11 # Just forward the inputs to the sub-module.\\n12 return self.predict(**kwargs)\\nThis is a fully-fledged module capable of learning effective few-shot prompting for any LM or task.\\nWe contrast that with Appendix C, which copies long reasoning prompts hand-written by sources\\nranging from recent research to popular prompting libraries.\\nParameterization Uniquely, DSPy parameterizes these prompting techniques. To understand this\\nparameterization, observe that any LM call seeking to implement a particular signature needs to\\nspecify parameters that include: (1) the specific LM to call (Chen et al., 2023), (2) the prompt in-\\nstructions (Yang et al., 2023) and the string prefix of each signature field and, most importantly, (3)\\nthe demonstrations used as few-shot prompts (for frozen LMs) or as training data (for finetuning).\\nWe focus primarily on automatically generating and selecting useful demonstrations. In our case\\nstudies, we find that bootstrapping good demonstrations gives us a powerful way to teach sophisti-\\ncated pipelines of LMs new behaviors systematically.\\nTools DSPy programs may use tools, which are modules that execute computation. We support re-\\ntrieval models through a dspy.Retrievemodule. At the time of writing, DSPy has built-in support\\nfor ColBERTv2, Pyserini, and Pinecone retrievers, and we have explored experimental dspy.SQL\\nfor executing SQL queries and dspy.PythonInterpreterfor executing Python code in a sandbox.\\nPrograms DSPy modules can be composed in arbitrary pipelines in a define-by-run interface. In-\\nspired directly by PyTorch and Chainer, one first declares the modules needed at initialization, allow-\\ning DSPy to keep track of them for optimization, and then one expresses the pipeline with arbitrary\\ncode that calls the modules in a forward method. As a simple illustration, we offer the following\\nsimple but complete retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system.\\n1 class RAG(dspy.Module):\\n2 def __init__(self, num_passages=3):\\n3 # ‘Retrieve‘ will use the user’s default retrieval settings unless overriden.\\n4 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=num_passages)\\n5 # ‘ChainOfThought‘ with signature that generates answers given retrieval & question.\\n6 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> answer\")\\n7\\n8 def forward(self, question):\\n9 context = self.retrieve(question).passages\\n10 return self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)\\nTo highlight modularity, we use ChainOfThought as a drop-in replacement of the basic Predict.\\nOne can now simply write RAG()(\"Where is Guaran ´ı spoken?\") to use it. Notice that, if we\\nuse a signature \"context, question -> search query\", we get a system that generates search\\nqueries rather than answers.\\n3.3 T ELEPROMPTERS CAN AUTOMATE PROMPTING FOR ARBITRARY PIPELINES\\nWhen compiling a DSPy program, we generally invoke a teleprompter, which is an optimizer that\\ntakes the program, a training set, and a metric—and returns a new optimized program.

Training examples may be incomplete, i.e., only input values are nec-\\nessary. Labels for the pipeline steps are not required, unless they need to be used in the metric. In\\npractice, we typically assume labels only for (at most) the program’s final output, not the intermedi-\\nate steps. This label-efficiency is critical for modularity: building a new pipeline in DSPy requires\\nsimply recompiling the new pipeline’s code, not annotating data specific to the new pipeline.\\nMetrics can be simple notions like exact match (EM) or F1, but they can be entire DSPy programs\\nthat balance multiple concerns. For example, we may compile the RAG module above against a\\ndataset of question–answer pairs qa trainset and the metric EM. The goal of optimization here is\\nto effectively bootstrap few-shot demonstrations. The following code achieves this:\\n1 # Small training set with only questions and final answers.\\n2 qa_trainset = [dspy.Example(question=\"What is the capital of France?\", answer=\"Paris\")]\\n3\\n4 # The teleprompter will bootstrap missing labels: reasoning chains and retrieval contexts.\\n5 teleprompter = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match)\\n6 compiled_rag = teleprompter.compile(RAG(), trainset=qa_trainset)\\nIn this example, the BootstrapFewShot teleprompter (Sec 4, Appendix E.1) simulates RAG on the\\ntraining example(s). It will collect demonstrations of each module (i.e., examples of its input–output\\nbehavior) that collectively lead to valid output (i.e., respecting the signatures and the metric).\\nIf one wanted to push the compiled program to be extractive given its retrieved contexts, one could\\ndefine a custom metric to use in place of dspy.evaluate.answer exact match:\\n1 def answer_and_context_match(example, pred, trace=None):\\n2 answer_match = dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match(example, pred)\\n3\\n4 # Is the prediction a substring of some passage?\\n5 context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)\\n6\\n7 return answer_match and context_match\\nNotice that behavior like this might be more accurately checked by another DSPy program that\\nchecks for faithful grounding of answers. Such metrics are fully supported and encouraged in DSPy.\\nTeleprompters can be composed by specifying a teacher program. DSPy will sample demonstra-\\ntions from this program for prompt optimization. This composition can enable very rich pipelines,\\nwhere expensive programs (e.g., complex expensive ensembles using large LMs) supervise cheap\\nprograms (e.g., simple pipelines using smaller LMs). One may start withcompiled ragfrom above\\n(say, compiled to use a large Llama2-13b-chat LM) but now fine-tune Flan-T5-large to create an\\nefficient program:\\n1 # Larger set of questions with *no labels*.

Compiling relies on a teleprompter, which is an optimizer for\\nDSPy programs that improves the quality (or cost) of modules via prompting or finetuning, which\\nare unified in DSPy. While DSPy does not enforce this when creating new teleprompters, typical\\nteleprompters go through three stages.\\nStage 1: Candidate GenerationThe compiler first (recursively) finds all uniquePredictmodules\\n(predictors) in a program, including those nested under other modules. For each unique predictor\\np, the teleprompter may generate candidate values for the parameters of p: the instructions, field\\ndescriptions, or—most importantly—demonstrations (i.e., example input–output pairs).

This teleprompter will simulate a teacher program (or, if unset, the zero-shot\\nversion of the program being compiled) on some training inputs, possibly one or more times with\\na high temperature. When running in compile mode, multi-stage traces are tracked transparently\\nand in a thread-safe fashion throughout execution. The program’s metric is used to filter for multi-\\nstage traces that together help the pipeline pass the metric. We thus obtain potential labels for all\\nsignatures in the program by throwing away the bad examples and using the good examples as\\npotential demonstrations, though these design decisions are under user control.\\nWhile LMs can be highly unreliable, we find they can be rather efficient at searching the space\\nof solutions for multi-stage designs. A well-decomposed program can typically find at least a few\\ntraining examples where the LM can pass the constraints enforced by the signatures and metrics,\\nallowing us to bootstrap iteratively if needed.\\nStage 2: Parameter OptimizationNow each parameter has a discrete set of candidates: demon-\\nstrations, instructions, etc. Many hyperparameter tuning algorithms (e.g., random search or Tree-\\nstructured Parzen Estimators as in HyperOpt (Bergstra et al., 2013) and Optuna (Akiba et al., 2019))\\ncan be applied for selection among candidates. We report simplified implementations of DSPy’s\\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch and BootstrapFewShotWithOptuna in Appendix E.2 and\\nAppendix E.3.\\nAnother type of optimization is finetuning with BootstrapFinetune, where the demonstrations are\\nused to update the LM’s weights for each predictor. When this is applied, the LM parameter of each\\nmodule is updated to the new LM weights. Typically, we are optimizing average quality using the\\nmetric with cross-validation over the training set or a validation set. This is applicable even with no\\nlabels for any stages, depending on the nature of metric.\\nStage 3: Higher-Order Program OptimizationA different type of optimization that the DSPy\\ncompiler supports is modifying the control flow of the program. One of the simplest forms of\\nthese is ensembles, which we use in the case studies in this work. An ensemble will bootstrap\\nmultiple copies of the same program, and then replace the program with a new one that runs them\\nall in parallel and reduces their predictions into one with a custom function (e.g., majority voting).\\nIn future work, this stage can easily accommodate techniques for more dynamic (i.e., test-time)\\nbootstrapping as well as automatic backtracking-like logic.\\n5 G OALS OF EVALUATION\\nProgramming frameworks can be evaluated along many dimensions: computational efficiency, de-\\nveloper efficiency, intuitiveness of the code and concepts, and so forth. In this paper, we focus on\\nperhaps the most pressing issue for current LM pipelines: the role of hand-written, task-specific\\nprompts in achieving performant systems. Our evaluations seek to test the following hypotheses:\\nH1 With DSPy, we can replace hand-crafted prompt strings with concise and well-defined\\nmodules, without reducing quality or expressive power.\\nH2 Parameterizing the modules and treating prompting as an optimization problem makes\\nDSPy better at adapting to different LMs, and it may outperform expert-written prompts.\\nH3 The resulting modularity makes it possible to more thoroughly explore complex pipelines\\nthat have useful performance characteristics or that fit nuanced metrics.\\nOur evaluation will explore these hypotheses using diverse task–program pairs. We hope this begins\\na shift from underspecified questions like “how do different LMs compare on GSM8K” toward “how\\nthey compare on GSM8K with program P when compiled with strategy S”, which is a well-defined\\nand reproducible run. Ultimately, our goal is to reduce the role of artful prompt construction in\\nmodern AI in favor of the development of new modular, composable programs and optimizers.\\n7', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Following prior work on GSM8K,\\nwe evaluate the accuracy of the final numerical value that appears in the LM output.\\nPrograms Considered For this task, we consider three simple DSPy programs: a one-step Pre-\\ndict module (vanilla), a two-step ChainOfThought module ( CoT), and finally a multi-stage Com-\\nparerOfThoughts module (ThoughtReflection). These are fully defined by the following code:\\n1 vanilla = dspy.Predict(\"question -> answer\") # GSM8K Program ‘vanilla‘\\n2\\n3 CoT = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"question -> answer\") # GSM8K Program ‘CoT‘\\n1 class ThoughtReflection(dspy.Module):\\n2 def __init__(self, num_attempts):\\n3 self.predict = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"question -> answer\", n=num_attempts)\\n4 self.compare = dspy.MultiChainComparison(’question -> answer’, M=num_attempts)\\n5\\n6 def forward(self, question):\\n7 completions = self.predict(question=question).completions\\n8 return self.compare(question=question, completions=completions)\\n9\\n10 reflection = ThoughtReflection(num_attempts=5) # GSM8K Program ‘reflection‘\\nIn reflection, five reasoning chains are sampled from the LM (alongside their answers) and they\\nare compared in parallel by a built-in MultiChainComparison module, which generalizes Yoran\\net al. (2023). This generates a new answer taking into account the patterns from the five attempts.\\nCritically, the modules used are all generic, none is specific math problems or particular LM.\\nCompiling As we discussed in Section 4, DSPy programs can be compiled into new, optimized\\nprograms. In our experiments, we evaluate the programs zero-shot (no compiling) as well as a\\nnumber of strategies for compiling.

Above, trainset does not include these reasoning\\nchains. We also evaluate with trainset human CoT, which extends the examples in trainsetwith\\nthe human reasoning string. These two datasets can be used interchangeably as the value for the\\ntrainset parameter above. We note here that compiling generally runs on the order of minutes\\n(or tens of minutes) as even the more expensive settings only require running the program a few\\nthousand times (e.g., 10–20 trials over 150–300 validation examples) and they can occur in parallel.\\nResults Our results are summarized in Table 1, which includes dev results as well as our evaluation\\nof promising representatives of each approach on the test set. First, the vanilla program results\\nshow that GPT-3.5 and llama2-13b-chat struggle with math word problems when they have to\\npredict the answers directly, that is, without using a reasoning chain first. This is most pronounced\\nin the absence of good demonstrations, which can be seen in the none compilation setting (i.e.,\\nzero-shot instruction) and the fewshot setting (i.e., sampling random question–answer pairs). In-\\nterestingly, however,vanillais helped substantially by compiling withbootstrapand by iterating\\nthis process into bootstrap×2. On inspecting the prompts bootstrapped (Appendix F), we see that\\nthe prompt allows the LM to leverage the answer field for reasoning first, which is permitted as the\\nmetric extracts the final numerical value for evaluation.\\nNext, we consider theCoTprogram. While the expert human reasoning chains (+human CoT) provide\\na large boost when available, we can match or surpass this using bootstrap, substantiating our\\nhypothesis that DSPy can cut the need for hand-crafted prompts. Beyond this, we see that the\\nreflectionprogram, while only a few lines longer than the others, is a clear winner, thoughCoTis\\nquite effective with ensemble. Overall, the bootstrap compilation procedure leads to large gains\\nfor every program, across both LMs. Indeed, all programs in this table are expressed by composing\\ntwo to four DSPy modules and teleprompters, and they reveal overall that—in the new paradigm\\nprescribed by DSPy—it’s composing the right generic modules, rather than manipulating string\\nprompts, that improves different LMs from 4–20% accuracy to 49–88% accuracy.\\nWe can informally compare with the following. Zhang et al. (2022) reports 48% for\\ntext-davinci-002, which aligns closely with our llama2-13b-chat results, and reports 59.4%\\nwith codex when employing a manual CoT approach and 62.8% with an automatic CoT method.\\nWang et al.

For retrieval, we use a search index of the of-\\nficial Wikipedia 2017 “abstracts” dump of HotPotQA. Search is conducted by a ColBERTv2 (San-\\nthanam et al., 2021) retriever. The HotPotQA test set is hidden, so we reserve the official validation\\nset for our testing, and sample 1000 examples for that. We sub-divide the training set into 70%/30%\\ntrain/validation splits. In the training (and thus validation) split, we keep only examples marked as\\n“hard” in the original dataset, which matches the designation of the official validation and test sets.\\nFor training and for reporting development results, we sample 200 and 300 examples respectively.\\nPrograms Considered Our simplest baseline is the vanilla program used in the previous case\\nstudy on GSM8K (Sec 6); the \"question -> answer\" signature is universal enough that it will\\nwork for this task (and many others) when compiled appropriately.\\nOur baseline RAG program is the one given in Section 3.2 as a simple example of RAG with a\\ndspy.ChainOfThought layer. We will see that this program does not excel at HotPotQA, and this\\nmotivates us to evaluate two multi-hop programs.\\nTo that end, we first test ReAct (Yao et al., 2022), a multi-step agent for tool use, which is imple-\\nmented as a built-in module in DSPy. In the simplest case, a ReAct module for a particular signature\\ncan be declared as follows in DSPy:\\n1 react = dspy.ReAct(\"question -> answer\", tools=[dspy.Retrieve(k=1)], max_iters=5)\\nWe also test the following custom program, which simulates the information flow in Baleen (Khattab\\net al., 2021a) and IRRR (Qi et al., 2020) and has similarities to IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2022).\\n1 class BasicMultiHop(dspy.Module):\\n2 def __init__(self, passages_per_hop):\\n3 self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages_per_hop)\\n4 self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> search_query\")\\n5 self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"context, question -> answer\")\\n6\\n7 def forward(self, question):\\n8 context = []\\n9\\n10 for hop in range(2):\\n11 query = self.generate_query(context=context, question=question).search_query\\n12 context += self.retrieve(query).passages\\n13\\n14 return self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)\\n15\\n16 multihop = BasicMultiHop(passages_per_hop=3)\\nCompiling For compilers, we continue to use the ones that we used for GSM8K (see Sec 6). We\\nalso consider two compositions of our teleprompters. For ReAct, we consider bootstrapping with\\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch starting from an earlier bootstrap of the ReAct program.\\nFor the simple multihop program, we also consider fine-tuning with T5-Large starting from the\\nearlier bootstrap of that program.\\n1 multihop_t5 = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=answer_exact_match).compile(program,\\nteacher=bootstrap, trainset=trainset, target=’t5-large’)\\nResults Table 2 summarizes our results. Compared with the vanillafew-shot prompting, a chain-\\nof-thought and retrieval-augmented generation ( CoT RAG) program can self-bootstrap in DSPy to\\nincrease answer EM substantially. However, this relies entirely on the ColBERTv2 retriever to find\\nrelevant passages directly from the original questions, limiting its passage recall. This is tackled in\\nthe reactand multihopprograms, which will generate queries for the retriever in multiple iterative\\n“hops”. Indeed, overall, a simple multihop program performs the best, and in general bootstrap\\nagain proves to be very effective at raising its quality relative to itsfewshot variant for both LMs.\\nIn particular, we can see that bootstrap (and/or bootstrap×2) can outperform both fewshot\\nprompting (for multihop) and expert human reasoning (for react; adapted slightly from Yao et al.\\n(2022) to our retrieval setting). Perhaps most importantly, we can makellama2-13b-chatcompet-\\nitive with GPT-3.5 by simply compiling our programs.\\nTo assess the finetuning capacity of DSPy, we also evaluated the compiler multihop t5 defined\\nabove which produces a T5-Large (770M parameter) model. This program scores 39.3% answer\\nEM and 46.0% passage accuracy on the dev set, using only 200 labeled inputs and 800 unlabeled\\n10', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Using CoT prompting, Si et al. (2022) achieve 25.2% EM. With a “recite-and-answer” tech-\\nnique that uses PaLM-62B (Chowdhery et al., 2022) to recite evidence passages, Sun et al. (2022)\\nachieve 26.5% EM. Wang et al. (2022a) achieve 33.8% EM and 44.6% F1 when applying self-\\nconsistency for PaLM-540B. Yao et al. (2022) achieve 27.4% EM using ReAct with PaLM-540B\\nand 30.8 with text-davinci-002, with a tool giving it the ability for search using a Wikipedia\\nAPI. They push their PaLM results to 35.1% EM by applying an additional CoT step with self-\\nconsistency, which may resemble our ensemble approach in the sense of aggregating multiple an-\\nswers. Trivedi et al. (2022) reports 49% using a pipeline with code-davinci-002 LM on a sample\\nof 500 HotPotQA questions.\\n8 C ONCLUSION\\nThis paper introduced DSPy, a new programming model for designing AI systems using pipelines\\nof pretrained LMs and other tools. We presented three new concepts introduced in this abstraction\\n(DSPy signatures, modules, and teleprompters), and showed in two very different case studies that\\nit supports rapid development of highly effective systems that use relatively small LMs. We have\\nmaintained open-source versions of this framework for close to a year. In this period, we have seen\\nand created a large number of programs that were compiled to high-quality systems by DSPy, span-\\nning tasks from information extraction to low-resource synthetic data generation. In the interest of\\nspace and to maintain reasonable scope in this paper, we leave reporting on such tasks under con-\\ntrolled experimental conditions to future work. While in-context learning has proved transformative\\nover the past 2–3 years of LM research, we argue that the true expressive power in this emerging\\nparadigm is in building sophisticated text transformation graphs in which composable modules and\\noptimizers (teleprompters) come together to leverage LMs in more systematic and reliable ways.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank Josh Purtell for suggesting the apt name “text transformation graph” for the computational\\ngraph abstraction of DSPy.

In particular, whereas the goal of DSPy\\nis to tackle the fundamental challenges of prompt engineering for building new LM computational\\ngraphs, LangChain and LlamaIndex generally help application developers who need pre-packaged\\ncomponents and chains, e.g., implementations of popular and reusable pipelines (e.g., particular\\nagents and specific retrieval pipelines) and tools (e.g., connections to various databases and imple-\\nmentations of long- and short-term memory for agents).\\nThese off-the-shelf higher-level abstractions contrast with DSPy’s focus on introducing core com-\\nposable operators. In particular, DSPy introduces signatures (to abstract prompts), modules (to\\nabstract prompting techniques), and teleprompters to act as optimizers for arbitrary imperative code\\n(DSPy programs) that chain modules together. Its goal is to help researchers and practitioners\\nbuild new LM pipelines quickly and achieve very high quality through automatic compilation (self-\\nimprovement) instead of manual prompt engineering.\\nIn contrast, typical existing research implementations and existing libraries like LangChain and\\nLlamaIndex are implemented using manual prompt engineering, which is the key problem that DSPy\\ntackles. We conducted an informal study to highlight this. In late September 2023, we found\\nthat the LangChain codebase contains 50 strings exceeding 1000 characters, which are generally\\nprompts, compared to none at all in DSPy. Indeed, a substantial number of LangChain’s Python\\nfiles are singularly dedicated to task-related templating and prompt engineering with 12prompts.py\\nfiles and and 42 prompt.py files. DSPy, on the other hand, provides a structured framework that\\nautomatically bootstraps prompts. The library itself does not contain a single hand-written prompt\\ndemonstration for any tasks at the time of writing, despite the very high quality with various LMs.\\nTo review the typical forms of prompt engineering in existing libraries, we consider the follow-\\ning in LangChain. The LangChain Program-Aided Language Model Gao et al. (2023a) chain pro-\\ngram uses few-shot learning, leveraging a template that is 3982 characters long with 8 math word\\nproblems (Prompt 2) and corresponding outputted programs as learning examples for the language\\nmodel. LangChain also contains a prompt for SQL query tasks for each of the databases like Or-\\nacle, GoogleSQL, DuckDB, Crate, and MySQL, with the average length of these prompts at 1058\\ncharacters. Other task areas such as QA with sources (Prompt B) and Graph QA also have signif-\\n17', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

Given an input question, first create a syntactically correct MyScale query to run, then look\\nat the results of the query and return the answer to the input question.\\n2 MyScale queries has a vector distance function called DISTANCE(column, array) to compute relevance to the user’s question\\nand sort the feature array column by the relevance.\\n3 When the query is asking for {top k} closest row, you have to use this distance function to calculate distance to entity’s\\narray on vector column and order by the distance to retrieve relevant rows.\\n4 *NOTICE*: DISTANCE(column, array) only accept an array column as its first argument and a NeuralArray(entity) as its second\\nargument. You also need a user defined function called NeuralArray(entity) to retrieve the entity’s array.\\n5 Unless the user specifies in the question a specific number of examples to obtain, query for at most {top k} results using\\nthe LIMIT clause as per MyScale. You should only order according to the distance function.\\n6 Never query for all columns from a table. You must query only the columns that are needed to answer the question. Wrap\\neach column name in double quotes (\") to denote them as delimited identifiers.\\n7 Pay attention to use only the column names you can see in the tables below.

No additional stimulus payments. Unlike 2020 and 2021, there were no new stimulus\\npayments for 2022 so taxpayers should not expect to get an additional payment.\\n9 Some tax credits return to 2019 levels. This means that taxpayers will likely receive a significantly smaller refund\\ncompared with the previous tax year. Changes include amounts for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit\\n(EITC) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit will revert to pre-COVID levels.\\n10 For 2022, the CTC is worth $2,000 for each qualifying child. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a\\nqualifying child. For the EITC, eligible taxpayers with no children will get $560 for the 2022 tax year. The Child and\\nDependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,100 in 2022.\\n11 No above-the-line charitable deductions. During COVID, taxpayers were able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax\\ndeduction on their tax returns. However, for tax year 2022, taxpayers who don’t itemize and who take the standard deduction,\\nwon’t be able to deduct their charitable contributions.\\n12 More people may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit. For tax year 2022, taxpayers may qualify for temporarily expanded\\neligibility for the premium tax credit.\\n13 Eligibility rules changed to claim a tax credit for clean vehicles.

We know\\nthat he needs to let it rise for 120 minutes twice, so that’s 240 minutes. Then, he needs to spend 10 minutes kneading it\\nand 30 minutes baking it. So, in total, it will take Mark 240 + 10 + 30 = 280 minutes to finish making the bread.\\n15 Answer: 280 ---\\n16\\n17 ---\\n18\\n19 Question: Ben has $2000 for his business operations costs.

How much money is Mr. Ben remaining with?\\n20 Reasoning: Let’s think step by step in order to find out how much money Mr. Ben is remaining with. We know that he had\\n$2000 to begin with, and he spent $600 on goods from his supplier, so he has $2000 - $600 = $1400 left. Then, his debtor\\npaid him $800, so he has $1400 + $800 = $2200. Finally, he spent $1200 on equipment maintenance, so he has $2200 - $1200\\n= $1000 left.\\n21 Answer: $1000 ---\\n22\\n23 ---\\n24\\n25 ... several other demonstrations here ...\\n26\\n27 ---\\n28\\n29 Question:\\nFigure 10: Shortened copy of the prompt automatically generated by DSPy for GSM8K Llama2-\\n13b-chat CoT program compiled with bootstrap.\\n31', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
